board.py - Sudoku Board Management Module

This module defines the `Board` class, which represents a 9x9 Sudoku board and contains methods to
manage the board's cells, find candidate numbers for empty cells, and apply solving techniques.
The `Board` class uses the `Cell` class from the `cell` module to represent each cell on the board.

Classes:
    - Board: Manages the layout and operations of a 9x9 Sudoku grid. It initializes from an input string
      representing the initial puzzle state and includes methods for finding possible values for each
      cell, based on Sudoku constraints within rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.

Key Methods:
    - __init__: Initializes the board with a provided string of 81 characters, where each character represents
      a cell's value or is a blank space (' ') for empty cells.
    - add_cell_num: Sets a specific number for a cell in the board.
    - output: Outputs the boardâ€™s current state to the console, showing numbers and blank spaces for empty cells.
    - find_candidates: Finds potential candidate values for each empty cell by eliminating values found in the
      same row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
    - check_cell_row, check_cell_col, check_cell_box: Supporting methods for `find_candidates` that respectively
      eliminate candidates in the same row, column, and subgrid.
    - apply_mono_candidates: Sets the number for a cell if it has exactly one candidate, confirming it as the
      final value for that cell.

Usage:
    - Initialize a `Board` instance with an 81-character string to represent the starting state of the board.
    - Call `find_candidates()` to calculate possible candidates for each empty cell.
    - Use `apply_mono_candidates()` to fill in cells with a single candidate.
    - Use `output()` to display the current state of the board.

Example:
    ```python
    init_nums = "  1   5        4    6 8  139       4     3 6 8 7  1    42  76 1   5 2      41   7"
    board = Board(init_nums)
    board.find_candidates()
    board.apply_mono_candidates()
    board.output()
    ```

Dependencies:
    - cell: Contains the `Cell` class, which represents individual cells on the board, with attributes
      for the cell's number and potential candidates.
